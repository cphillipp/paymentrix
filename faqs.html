				          <p><strong><a name="1"></a>Q: What  is PCI?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>The Payment Card Industry Data  Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that <strong>ALL</strong> companies that <strong>process, store </strong>or<strong> transmit </strong>credit  card information maintain a secure environment.   Essentially any merchant that has a Merchant ID (MID).<br />

				            The Payment Card Industry Security  Standards Council (PCI SSC) was launched on September 7, 2006 to manage the  ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards with focus  on improving payment account security throughout the transaction process.  The PCI DSS is administered and managed by  the PCI SSC (www.pcisecuritystandards.org), an independent body that was  created by the major payment card brands (Visa, MasterCard, American Express,  Discover and JCB.). <br />
				            It is important to note, the  payment brands and acquirers are responsible for enforcing compliance, not the  PCI council. <br />
				            A copy of the PCI DSS is available <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/download.html?id=pci_dss_v1-2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Q: To  whom does PCI apply?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>PCI applies to ALL organizations  or merchants, regardless of size or number of transactions, that accepts,  transmits or stores any cardholder data. Said another way, if any customer  of that organization ever pays the merchant directly using a credit card or  debit card, then the PCI DSS requirements apply.</p>

				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="3" id="3" ></a>Q: Where can I find the PCI Data Security Standards (PCI DSS)?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>The Standard can be found on the PCI SSC's Website: <br />
				  <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pci_dss.shtml" target="_blank">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pci_dss.shtml</a></p>
				            <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="4"></a>Q: What  are the PCI compliance deadlines?</strong><br />

				  <strong>A: </strong>All merchant that stores,  processes or transmits cardholder data must be compliant now.  However, as a Level 4 merchant, you will have  to refer to your merchant bank for their specific validation requirements and  deadlines.  All deadline enforcement will  come from your merchant bank. You may also find more information on Visa's  Website: </p>

				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				          <p><strong><a name="5"></a>Q: What  are the PCI compliance 'levels' and how are they determined?</strong><br />
				            <strong>A: </strong>All merchants will fall into one of the four  merchant levels based on Visa transaction volume over a 12-month period.  Transaction volume is based on the aggregate number of Visa transactions  (inclusive of credit, debit and prepaid) from a merchant Doing Business As  ('DBA'). In cases where a merchant corporation has more than one DBA, Visa acquirers  must consider the aggregate volume of transactions stored, processed or  transmitted by the corporate entity to determine the validation level. If data  is not aggregated, such that the corporate entity does not store, process or  transmit cardholder data on behalf of multiple DBAs, acquirers will continue to  consider the DBA's individual transaction volume to determine the validation  level. <br />

				          </table>
				            <strong>A: </strong>To satisfy the requirements of  PCI, a merchant must complete the following steps:</p>
				          <ul>

				            <li>Identify  your Validation Type as defined by PCI DSS - see below .  This is used to determine which Self  Assessment Questionnaire is appropriate for your business.  </li>
				          </ul>
				          <p align="center"><img src="https://www.controlscan.com/images/faq_saq_validation_type.gif" width="515" height="214" /></p>
				          <ul>
				            <li>Complete  the Self-Assessment Questionnaire according to the instructions in the Self-  Assessment Questionnaire Instructions and Guidelines. </li>
				          </ul>
				          <ul>
				            <li>Complete  and obtain evidence of a passing vulnerability scan with a PCI SSC Approved  Scanning Vendor (ASV).  <strong>Note</strong> scanning does not apply to all  merchants.  It is required for Validation  Type 4 and 5 - those merchants with external facing IP addresses.  Basically if you electronically store  cardholder information or if your processing systems have any internet  connectivity, a quarterly scan by an approved scanning vendor is required.          </li>

				          </ul>
				          <ul>
				            <li>Complete  the relevant Attestation of Compliance in its entirety (located in the SAQ  tool). </li>
				          </ul>
				          <ul>
				            <li>Submit  the SAQ, evidence of a passing scan (if applicable), and the Attestation of  Compliance, along with any other requested documentation, to your acquirer.          </li>
				          </ul>
				          <ul>

				            <li>I'm  a small merchant with very few card transactions; do I need to be compliant  with PCI DSS?</li>
				          </ul>
				          <p>All merchants, small or large,  need to be PCI compliant. The payment brands have collectively adopted PCI DSS  as the requirement for organizations that process, store or transmit payment  cardholder data.</p>
				          <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				          <p><strong><a name="7"></a>Q: If  I only accept credit cards over the phone, does PCI still apply to me?</strong><br />
				            <strong>A: </strong>Yes. All business that store,  process or transmit payment cardholder data must be PCI Compliant.</p>

				          <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="8" ></a>Q: Do  organizations using third-party processors have to be PCI compliant?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>Yes. Merely using a third-party  company does not exclude a company from PCI compliance. It may cut down on their  risk exposure and consequently reduce the effort to validate compliance.  However, it does not mean they can ignore PCI.</p>
				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="8b" ></a>Q: My  business has multiple locations, is each location required to validate PCI  Compliance?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>If your business locations  process under the same Tax ID, then typically you are only required to validate  once annually for all locations. And, submit quarterly passing network scans by  an PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV), if applicable.</p>

				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><span class="backtop"><a name="9"></a></span>Q: Are  debit card transactions in scope for PCI?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>In-scope cards include any debit, credit, and  pre-paid cards branded with one of the five card association/brand logos that  participate in the <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" target="_blank">PCI SSC</a> - American Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, and  Visa International. </p>
				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="10" ></a>Q: Am  I PCI compliant if I have an SSL certificate?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>No.  SSL certificates do not secure a Web server  from malicious attacks or intrusions. High assurance SSL certificates provide  the first tier of customer security and reassurance such as the below, but  there are other steps to achieve PCI Compliance.  See Question <strong>"<a href="#6">What does a small-to-medium  sized business (Level 4 merchant) have to do in order to satisfy the PCI  requirements?</a>"</strong></p>

				          <ul>
				            <li>A secure connection between the customer's  browser and the web server</li>
				            <li>Validation that the Website operators are a  legitimate, legally accountable organization</li>
				            </ul>
				          <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				          <p><strong><a name="11" ></a>Q: What  are the penalties for noncompliance?</strong><br />
				            <strong>A: </strong>The payment brands may, at their  discretion, fine an acquiring bank $5,000 to $100,000 per month for PCI  compliance violations. The banks will most likely pass this fine on downstream  till it eventually hits the merchant. Furthermore, the bank will also most  likely either terminate your relationship or increase transaction fees.  Penalties are not openly discussed nor widely  publicized, but they can catastrophic to a small business.  </p>

				<p>It is important to be familiar  with your merchant account agreement, which should outline your exposure.</p>
				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="12" ></a>Q: What  is defined as 'cardholder data'?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>Cardholder data is any  personally identifiable data associated with a cardholder. This could be an  account number, expiration date, name, address, social security number, etc.  All personally identifiable information associated with the cardholder that is  stored, processed, or transmitted is also considered cardholder data.</p>
				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="13"></a>Q: What  is the definition of 'merchant'?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>For the purposes of the PCI DSS,  a merchant is defined as any entity that accepts payment cards bearing the  logos of any of the five members of PCI SSC (American Express, Discover, JCB,  MasterCard or Visa) as payment for goods and/or services. Note that a merchant  that accepts payment cards as payment for goods and/or services can also be a  service provider, if the services sold result in storing, processing, or  transmitting cardholder data on behalf of other merchants or service providers.  For example, an ISP is a merchant that accepts payment cards for monthly  billing, but also is a service provider if it hosts merchants as customers</p>

				<p><strong><a name="14" ></a>Q: What  constitutes a Service Provider?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>Any company that stores,  processes, or transmits cardholder data on behalf of another entity is defined  to be a Service Provider by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) guidelines.</p>
				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="15" ></a>Q: What  constitutes a payment application?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>What constitutes a payment  application as it relates to PCI Compliance? The term payment application has a  very broad meaning in PCI.  A payment  application is anything that stores, processes, or transmits card data  electronically.  This means that anything  from a Point of Sale System (e.g., Verifone swipe terminals, ALOHA terminals,  etc.) in a restaurant to a Website e-commerce shopping cart (e.g., CreLoaded,  osCommerce, etc) are all classified as payment applications. Therefore any  piece of software that has been designed to touch credit card data is  considered a payment application.</p>

				<p><strong><a name="16"></a>Q: What  is a payment gateway?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>Payment Gateways connect a merchant  to the bank or processor that is acting as the front-end connection to the Card  Brands. They are called gateways because they take many inputs from a variety  of different applications and route those inputs to the appropriate bank or processor.   Gateways communicate with the bank or  processor using dial-up connections, Web-based connections or privately held  leased lines.</p>

				<p><strong><a name="17" ></a>Q: How  is IP-based POS environment defined?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>The point of sale (POS)  environment refers to a transaction that takes place at a merchant location  (i.e. retail store, restaurant, hotel, gas station, convenience store, etc.).  An Internet protocol (IP) -based POS is when transactions are stored,  processed, or transmitted on IP-based systems or systems communicating via  TCP/IP.</p>

				<p><strong><a name="18"></a>Q: What  is PA-DSS and PABP?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>PA-DSS refers to Payment  Application Data Security Standard maintained by the PCI Security Standards  Council.  PABP is Visa's Payment  Application Best Practices, which is now referred to as PA-DSS.  Visa started the program and it is being  transitioned to the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC).</p>
				<p>To address the critical issue of  payment application security, in 2005 Visa created the Payment Application Best  Practices (PABP) requirements to ensure vendors provide products which support  merchants' efforts to maintain PCI DSS compliance and eliminate the storage of  sensitive cardholder data. See <a href="http://www.visa.com/pabp">www.visa.com/pabp</a> for more information.</p>
				          <p>The Payment Card Industry  Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) will maintain the PA-DSS and administer a  program to validate payment applications' compliance against this standard. The  PCI SSC now publishes and maintains a list of PA-DSS validated  applications.  See <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pa_dss.shtml">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pa_dss.shtml</a> for more information.</p>

				          <p><strong><a name="19" ></a>Q: Can  the full credit card number be printed on the consumer's copy of the receipt?</strong><br />
				            <strong>A: </strong>PCI DSS requirement 3.3 states  &quot;Mask PAN when displayed (the first six and last four digits are the  maximum number of digits to be displayed)." While the requirement does not  prohibit printing of the full card number or expiry date on receipts (either  the merchant copy or the consumer copy), please note that PCI DSS does not  override any other laws that legislate what can be printed on receipts (such as  the U.S. Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) or any other  applicable laws). See the italicized note under PCI DSS requirement 3.3 “Note:  This requirement does not apply to employees and other parties with a specific  need to see the full PAN, nor does the requirement supersede stricter  requirements in place for displays of cardholder data (for example, for point  of sale (POS) receipts)." Any paper receipts stored by merchants must adhere to  the PCI DSS, especially requirement 9 regarding physical security.          </p>

				<p><strong><a name="20"></a>Q: Do  I need vulnerability scanning to validate compliance?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>If you electronically store  cardholder data post authorization or if your processing systems have any  internet connectivity, a quarterly scan by a PCI SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV)  is required.</p>

				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="21" ></a>Q: What  is a network security scan?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>A network security scan involves  an automated tool that checks a merchant or service provider's systems for  vulnerabilities. The tool will conduct a non-intrusive scan to remotely review  networks and Web applications based on the external-facing Internet protocol  (IP) addresses provided by the merchant or service provider. The scan will  identify vulnerabilities in operating systems, services, and devices that could  be used by hackers to target the company's private network.  As provided by an Approved Scanning Vendors  (ASV's) such as ControlScan the tool will not require the merchant or service  provider to install any software on their systems, and no denial-of-service  attacks will be performed. <br />
				            Note, typically only merchants  with external facing IP address are required to have passing quarterly scans to  validate PCI compliance. This is usually merchants completing the SAQ C or D  version.</p>
				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="22"></a>Q: How  often do I have to scan?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>Every 90 days/once per quarter  you are required to submit a passing scan. Merchants and service providers  should submit compliance documentation (successful scan reports) according to  the timetable determined by their acquirer. Scans must be conducted by a PCI  SSC Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV). ControlScan is a PCI Approved Scanning  Vendor.</p>

				<div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><strong><a name="23" ></a>Q: What  if a merchant refuses to cooperate?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>PCI is not, in itself, a law. The  standard was created by the major card brands such as Visa, MasterCard,  Discover, AMEX, and JCB. At their acquirers/service providers discretion,  merchants that do not comply with PCI DSS may be subject to fines, card  replacement costs, costly forensic audits, brand damage, etc., should a breach  event occur.  </p>
				<p>For a little upfront effort and  cost to comply with PCI, you greatly help reduce your risk from facing these  extremely unpleasant and costly consequences.</p>

				          <p><strong><a name="24"></a>Q: If  I'm running a business from my home, am I a serious target for hackers?</strong><br />
				            <strong>A: </strong>Yes, home users are arguably the  most vulnerable simply because they are usually not well protected. Adopting a  'path of least resistance' model, intruders will often zero-in on home users -  often exploiting their 'always on' broadband connections and typical home use  programs such as chat, Internet games and P2P files sharing applications. ControlScan's  scanning service allows home users and network administrators alike to identify  and fix any security vulnerabilities on their desktop or laptop computers.</p>

				          <p><strong><a name="25"></a>Q: What  should I do if I'm compromised?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>We recommend following the procedures  outlined in Visa's" What to Do If Compromised<br />
				            Visa Fraud Control and  Investigations Procedures" document.   Link below.</p>

				<p><strong><a name="26" ></a>Q: Do  states have laws that requiring data breach notifications to the affected  parties?</strong><br />
				  <strong>A: </strong>Absolutely. California is the catalyst  for reporting data breaches to affected parties. The state implemented breach  notification law in 2003 and there are now over 38 states that have similar  laws in place.  See <a href="http://www.privacyrights.org">www.privacyrights.org</a> for more detail  on state laws.</p>
