				          <p><a name="myth1"></a><strong>Myth: I'm  a small merchant who only takes a handful of cards, so I don't need PCI.</strong><br />
				            <strong>Fact: </strong>This is a common misunderstanding with the  standard, that small merchants handling only one or a few credit cards a year  are exempt from compliance. If you are a merchant and are set up to take credit  cards by any mechanism - then you need to be complaint.
				          </p>
				          <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				          <p><a name="myth2"></a><strong>Myth: PCI  only applies to e-commerce companies.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact: </strong>No, PCI applies to every company that stores,  processes or transmits cardholder information. In fact anyone who takes card  present transactions that involve POS devices are typically more at risk than e-commerce  solutions. Quite often these types of transactions involve storage of track  data (which is forbidden under PCI). Compromise of this type of data may bring  heavy fines and requests for compensation from the banks involved.</p>

				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth3"></a><strong>Myth: You  only have to be PCI compliant with the majority of criteria.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact: </strong>The pass mark for PCI is 100%, so if you  fail even one of the criteria, you are not PCI compliant. The standard is not  meant to be something to strive for; it is essentially a floor, a basis for  further security measures. Failing to achieve even one of the requirements, is  failing to meet a basic standard for handling cardholder information. All  companies that routinely handle this type of data should be aiming to exceed  the standard. It's just good business.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth4"></a><strong>Myth: I only need to protect my credit card data, not ATM debit card related data.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact: </strong>Incorrect - both are required. Many debit  cards are dual-purpose 'signature debit', which can be used on debit and credit  card networks. As such, they are covered under PCI and must be protected in the  same way as credit cards.</p>

				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth5"></a><strong>Myth: I can wait until my business grows.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact: </strong>Incorrect - the PCI standard applies to all  sizes of business and waiting could be costly. Should you be compromised and  not be PCI compliant, the fines and the compensation requirements by the banks  (it typically costs between $50 and $90 to replace one card) could be  substantial.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth6"></a><strong>Myth: I can just answer 'yes' to all the criteria on the Self-Assessment Questionnaire  (SAQ).</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> The Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) is  a mechanism for getting the information about the level of your compliance to  your merchant bank. The standard applies at all times. Just saying yes to the  questions puts you at great risk. If a compromise took place and it was obvious  that you were not and have never been PCI compliant, the matter would be taken  very seriously. You would be risking your whole business by answering 'yes' to  the questions, when there is no factual basis for the answers.</p>

				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth7"></a><strong>Myth: I  can wait until my bank asks me to be PCI compliant.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> The dates for merchants to be PCI compliant  are long gone. You are responsible for making sure you are in compliance.  Waiting until the bank asks you could be very costly indeed.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<a name="myth8"></a><br />

				<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="padding:0px;margin:0px;">
				  <tr>

				    <td valign="top"><strong>Myth:&nbsp;</strong></td>
				    <td><strong>As  a merchant, I did not sign anything saying I would be complaint; therefore, I  don't need to be.</strong></td>
				  </tr>
				</table>
				<strong>Fact:</strong> The PCI standard forms part of the  operating regulations that are the rules under which merchants are allowed to  operate merchant accounts. The regulations signed when you open an account at  the bank state that the VISA regulations have to be adhered to. Even if you  have been in business for decades, PCI still applies if you store, process or  transmit credit cards.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth9"></a><strong>Myth: As  a merchant, I'm entitled to store any data.</strong><br />

				  <strong>Fact:</strong> Many merchants believe that they own the  customer and have a right to store all the data about that customer in order to  help their business. Not only is this incorrect regarding PCI, it may also be a  violation of State and Federal legislation regarding privacy. The PCI  regulations specifically forbid storing of any of the following:          </p>
				<ol>
				  <ol>
				    <li>Unencrypted credit card number </li>
				    <li>CVV or CVV2 </li>
				    <li>Pin blocks </li>

				    <li>PIN numbers </li>
				    <li>Track 1 or 2 data </li>
				    </ol>
				</ol>
				          <p>Any of the above found in databases, log  files, audit trails, backup's etc. can result in serious consequences for the  merchant, especially if a compromise has taken place.</p>
				          <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				          <p><a name="myth10"></a><strong>Myth: One  vendor and product will make us compliant.</strong><br />

				            <strong>Fact: </strong>Many vendors offer an array of software and  services for PCI compliance. No single vendor or product, however, fully  addresses all 12 requirements of PCI DSS. When marketing focuses on one  product's capabilities and excludes positioning these with other requirements  of PCI DSS, the resulting perception of a 'silver bullet' might lead some to  believe that the point product provides 'compliance', when it's really  implementing just one or a few pieces of the standard. The PCI Security  Standards Council urges merchants and processors to avoid focusing on point  products for PCI security and compliance. Instead of relying on a single  product or vendor, you should implement a holistic security strategy that  focuses on the 'big picture' related to the intent of PCI DSS requirements.</p>
				            <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth11"></a><strong>Myth: Outsourcing  card processing makes us compliant.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> Outsourcing simplifies payment card  processing but does not provide automatic compliance. Don't forget to address  policies and procedures for cardholder transactions and data processing. Your  business must protect cardholder data when you receive it, and process charge  backs and refunds. You must also ensure that providers' applications and card  payment terminals comply with respective PCI standards and do not store  sensitive cardholder data. You should request a certificate of compliance  annually from providers.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

				<p><a name="myth12"></a><strong>Myth: PCI  compliance is an IT project.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> The IT staff implements technical and  operational aspects of PCI-related systems, but compliance to the payment  brand's programs is much more than a 'project' with a beginning and end - it's  an ongoing process of assessment, remediation and reporting. PCI compliance is  a business issue that is best addressed by a multi-disciplinary team. The risks  of compromise are financial and reputational, so they affect the whole  organization. Be sure your business addresses policies and procedures as they  apply to the entire card payment acceptance and processing workflow.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth13"></a><strong>Myth: PCI  will make us secure.</strong><br />

				  <strong>Fact:</strong> Successful completion of a system scan or  assessment for PCI is but a snapshot in time. Security exploits are non-stop  and get stronger every day, which is why PCI compliance efforts must be a  continuous process of assessment and remediation to ensure safety of cardholder  data.</p>

				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth14"></a><strong>Myth: PCI  is unreasonable; it requires too much.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> Most aspects of the PCI DSS are already a  common best practice for security. The standard also permits the option using  compensating controls to meet some requirements. The standard provides  significant detail, which benefits merchants and processors by not leaving them  to wonder, 'Where do I go from here?' This scope and flexibility leads some to  view PCI DSS as an effective standard for securing all sensitive information.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth15"></a><strong>Myth: PCI  requires us to hire a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> Because most large merchants have complex  IT environments, many hire a QSA to glean their specialized value for on-site  security assessments required by PCI DSS. The QSA also makes it easier to  develop and get approval for a compensating control. However, PCI DSS provides  the option of doing an internal assessment with an officer sign-off if your  acquirer and/or merchant bank agrees. Mid-sized and smaller merchants may use  the Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) found on the PCI SSC Website to assess  themselves.</p>

				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth16"></a><strong>Myth: PCI  makes us store cardholder data.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> Both PCI DSS and the payment card brands  strongly discourage storage of cardholder data by merchants and processors.  There is no need, nor is it allowed, to store data from the magnetic stripe on  the back of a payment card. If merchants or processors have a business reason  to store front-card information, such as name and account number, PCI DSS  requires this data to be encrypted or made otherwise unreadable.</p>
				  <div class="backtop"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>
				<p><a name="myth17"></a><strong>Myth: PCI  is too hard.</strong><br />
				  <strong>Fact:</strong> Understanding and implementing the 12  requirements of PCI DSS can seem daunting, especially for merchants without  security or a large IT department. However, PCI DSS mostly calls for good,  basic security. Even if there was no requirement for PCI compliance, the best  practices for security contained in the standard are steps that every business would  want to take anyways to protect sensitive data and continuity of operations.  There are many products and services available to help meet the requirements  for security - and PCI compliance.</p>

				<p>When people say PCI is too hard, many really  mean to say compliance is not cheap. The business risks and ultimate costs of  non-compliance, however, can vastly exceed implementing PCI DSS - such as  fines, legal fees, decreases in stock equity, and especially lost business.  Implementing PCI DSS should be part of a sound, basic enterprise security  strategy, which requires making this activity part of your ongoing business  plan and budget.</p>
